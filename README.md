# ANLY503_Portfolio

Check out this portfolio and my final project at my website: https://nayoder.github.io/ANLY503_Portfolio/

A few notes about this repository:
- The data/ folder that has all of the previous assignments' data files was hidden from Git, since some of the files were large. I assumed that wouldn't be an issue since the TAs/professors should have that data already. Just make sure you put it in my porfolio's directory if you want to run my code.
- I included the Lato.ttf file in case you need it.
